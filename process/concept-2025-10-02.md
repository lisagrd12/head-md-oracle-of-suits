## RESEARCH 
I became interested in : why people played card games ?
This universal game, ancient and very simple. 56 cards and an infinite number of games. Everyone has their own rules, their own games, their own history, their own heritage of card games. 

I began researching memories. Memories of the first game, the places where games were played, the emotions, the power of nostalgia in the eyes of everyone who remembers their best card game.

## Nostagia 
I would like to build a passage between time to relive memories, like a relay of memories.

I want to create anchor points where visitors can find connections between their intimate selves and others.

Project yourself, step into anotherâ€™s shoes, and relive your own memories through theirs and rediscover the child within us.
This becomes a window, a path where everyone can reconnect with their memories and stories. 

## KEYWORD
RELAY OF MEMORIES

## USER JOURNEY 
- Find the entrance to the memory. 

Create a path to one's own memory, with a broad base, and enable the visitor to grasp and reconstruct their own reality through their own eyes.
 I have to find a sufficiently intimate entrance and a protocol to stimulate memories that may have been forgotten. Appeal to emotions, atmosphere, sound, images... to bring the memory back to life in the person's mind with nostagia.
