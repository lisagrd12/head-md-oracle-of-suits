Simple interactive sketch: draw with your left hand and erase with your right hand. The grid stays visible at all times.


## Controls
- Left click / primary input: draw on the grid.
- Right click / secondary input: erase.
- Touch: tap to draw; long-press or two-finger touch may act as erase depending on browser/device (check sketch behavior).


## Notes
- Grid is permanent by design; to clear strokes, use the erase action.
- Adjust brush size, grid spacing, and colors in sketch.js.
